# faceRecognition
face recognition
creating a One-shot Siamese Neural Network, using TensorFlow 2.0, based on the work presented by Gregory Koch, Richard Zemel, and Ruslan Salakhutdinov. As specified, we used the “Labeled Faces in the Wild” dataset with over 5,700 different people from this refrence http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/#download .
The training dataset includes this data and getting around 800 picture from our webcam, the model will receive two input image and classify it True or false using output sigmoid activation .
The picture below shows the architecture of the model base by the Siamese paper
